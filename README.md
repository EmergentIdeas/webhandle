Web Handle
==========

I love writing web applications.  I have a fondness for any tool which makes the writing faster and makes me feel correspondingly cooler.

I like the Java programming language, verbose as it is, because the coding is easy, the toolkits are plentiful, the testing is straightforward.
It allows me to construct complicated apps without bugs being introduced by the language, my ignorance of certain language features, or my 
temporary inattention to a language "feature".

I like Spring and its dependency injection.


What I want:
1.	An environment that doesn't make me specify a cargo container ship of configuration but is not so strongly wedded to its conventions
that they are a pain to change.
2.	To be able to program for the web in Java.
3.	To build pieces of applications I can reuse in other applications.
4.	A framework that doesn't fight me for control but acts as a programming buddy, helpful and responsive to my will.


I've been high as kite all week on the satisfaction of what's already working (enough to create apps, end to end functional).  
I've got some info about the basics at [webhandle basics](docs/basics.md).

Although I'm writing webhandle for my own use, I hope it works for you as well.  Feel free to grab a copy and use it under the Apache 2 license.  Also,
please send me any questions or suggestions you might have.
