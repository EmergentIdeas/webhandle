Configuring Objects
===================

==@Resource
Any field which has a Resource annotation will be wired by the name and type specified in
the annotation or, if they are not specified, by the name and type of the field.

An method which has a Resource annotation will be called with the parameter assumed to be
the name specified in the Resource annotation or named according to the regular rules if
no name is specified in the annotation.

Any class which has a resource annotation will be added as a service with the name and type
specified in the annotation or the simple name of the class (first letter lower case) if no
name is specified and with a type of the type of the class if no type is specified.




Handling Web Requests
=====================

==@Handle

@Handle is the webhandle specific annotation that let's you declare path, path variables
and request type


==J2EE Annotations

J2EE6 Annotations can also be used.
@Path will declare the path and path variables.  An example is: @Path("/to/resource/{id:\\d+}")

J2EE6 also uses the annotations @GET, @POST, @HEAD, @PUT, @DELETE, @OPTIONS.  Using one or more of
these on a method in combination with a @Path will restrict the request to only those HTTP methods.
If no HTTP method is defined, then all methods will be assumed to be acceptable.
